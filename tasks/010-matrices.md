# Lesson 10: Matrices

## The Story: The Copy-Paste Nightmare

Imagine you're maintaining a popular open-source library. One day, a user reports that your library doesn't work on
Node.js version 18. Another user complains it fails on Windows. A third mentions issues on macOS with Node 20.

You think, "No problem! I'll just add more test jobs to my workflow." So you start writing:

```yaml
jobs:
  test-node-18:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test

  test-node-20:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test

  test-node-22:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # ... and so on ...
```

But wait, you also need to test on Windows and macOS! That's 3 Node versions × 3 operating systems = 9 nearly identical
jobs. And if you need to update one step, you'll have to change it in 9 places. There has to be a better way...

**Enter matrix builds!** 🎯

## What Are Matrix Builds?

Matrix builds allow you to automatically create multiple job variations by defining variables that get combined in
different ways. Instead of writing 9 separate jobs, you define the dimensions you want to test (Node versions and
operating systems), and GitHub Actions creates all the combinations for you.

Think of it like a spreadsheet table where:

- Rows represent one variable (e.g., Node versions: 18, 20, 22)
- Columns represent another variable (e.g., OS: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Each cell in the table becomes a separate job

## Basic Matrix Syntax

Here's a simple matrix example:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        node-version: [18, 20, 22]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

This single job definition will create **9 jobs** (3 OS × 3 Node versions), each running in parallel!

The `${{ matrix.os }}` and `${{ matrix.node-version }}` syntax accesses the current combination's values.

## When to Use Matrices

Matrix builds are perfect for:

- **Cross-platform testing**: Testing on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Multiple language versions**: Testing with different Node.js, Python, or Ruby versions
- **Different configurations**: Testing with different database versions, dependencies, or build flags
- **Browser testing**: Testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

## Matrix Features

### Including Specific Combinations

Sometimes you want to add extra configurations:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    node-version: [18, 20]
    include:
      # Add a specific combination
      - os: macos-latest
        node-version: 22
```

### Excluding Specific Combinations

You might want to skip certain combinations:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    node-version: [18, 20, 22]
    exclude:
      # Skip Windows with Node 18 because it has a known incompatibility we won't try to fix
      - os: windows-latest
        node-version: 18
```

### Fail-Fast Behavior

By default, if one matrix job fails, GitHub Actions cancels all other running matrix jobs. You can change this:

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false # Continue running other jobs even if one fails
  matrix:
    # ...
```

## Task: Add Matrix Testing to Your Project

Your task is to create a workflow that tests this project across multiple configurations.

**Requirements:**

1. Create a new workflow file `.github/workflows/matrix-test.yml`
2. The workflow should trigger on `pull_request` events, so remember to create a new branch and open a PR to test it
3. Use a matrix strategy to test on:
   - Operating systems: `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`
   - Node.js versions: `18`, `20`, `22`
4. Each job should:
   - Check out the code
   - Set up the specified Node.js version
   - Install dependencies using `npm install`
   - Run tests using `npm test`
5. Set `fail-fast: false` so all combinations run even if one fails
6. Give each job a descriptive name that shows which OS and Node version it's using

**Bonus Challenge:**

- Exclude the combination of `macos-latest` with Node.js `18` (pretend there's a known compatibility issue)
- Add an extra test run on `ubuntu-latest` with Node.js `16` using the `include` feature

```yaml
name: Matrix Testing

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    name: Test on ${{ matrix.os }} with Node ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        node-version: [18, 20, 22]
        exclude:
          # Skip macOS with Node 18 due to known compatibility issue
          - os: macos-latest
            node-version: 18
        include:
          # Add extra test on Ubuntu with Node 16
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            node-version: 16

    steps:
      - name: Check out the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - name: Set up Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

This workflow will create 9 jobs total:

- 3 for ubuntu-latest (Node 16, 18, 20, 22) = 4 jobs
- 3 for windows-latest (Node 18, 20, 22) = 3 jobs
- 2 for macos-latest (Node 20, 22) = 2 jobs (Node 18 excluded)

Each job runs independently and in parallel, giving you comprehensive test coverage across platforms and Node versions!

## Summary

Matrix builds are a powerful way to test your code across multiple configurations without duplicating workflow code.
They save time, reduce errors, and make your workflows much easier to maintain.
