# Getting Started

## 1. Create a new repository from this template

Click the ["Use this template"](https://github.com/new?template_name=github-actions-workshop&template_owner=boyum)
button at the top of this repository to create a new repository from this template. If you need to decide, we suggest
using your personal GitHub account.

You can name the repository whatever you like, but we will refer to it as `github-actions-workshop` throughout the
workshop.

> [!TIP]
> Public repositories can use GitHub Actions for free with generous limits. Also, having the repo public avoids
> some issues with Actions in private repos. Therefore, we recommend making your repository public.

## 2. Open the repository

### Locally

Clone your new repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/github-actions-workshop.git
cd github-actions-workshop
```

### Online on GitHub.dev

You can also use [GitHub.dev](https://github.dev) to edit files directly in your browser without cloning locally.

1. Navigate to your new repository on GitHub
2. Press the `.` key on your keyboard (or replace `github.com` with `github.dev` in the URL)

This opens a lightweight version of VSCode in your browser. Apart from some quality-of-life features missing (like
terminal access), it works similarly to VSCode on your computer.

## 3. Let's Start the Workshop!

> [!NOTE]
> Before we begin, we just want to say: don't feel discouraged if you don't finish all of the lessons during the
> workshop! Some of the tasks are quite lengthy and challenging. The goal is to learn and have fun along the way.

Open [the first lesson](./001-your-first-workflow.md) and begin your journey!
