# Lesson 14: Advanced Topics & Further Reading

## Congratulations! 🎉

You've completed the core GitHub Actions workshop! You now know how to:

- Create workflows that build, test, and deploy code
- Use artifacts and outputs to share data between jobs
- Set up branch protection and automated dependency management
- Optimize workflows for speed and efficiency

## What's Next?

Here are advanced topics to explore as you continue your GitHub Actions journey:

---

## 🏠 **Local Development**

### **Act - Run GitHub Actions Locally**

Test workflows on your machine without pushing to GitHub.

- **Documentation**: [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
- **Installation**: `brew install act` (macOS) or `choco install act-cli` (Windows)
- **Basic usage**: `act` (runs all workflows) or `act push` (simulate push event)
- **Custom runners**: Use Docker images that match GitHub's environment
- **Secrets**: `act -s GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token` for local testing with secrets

## 🔧 **Advanced Workflow Patterns**

### **Reusable Workflows**

Share common workflows across repositories.

- **Docs**: [Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
- **Use case**: Organization-wide CI/CD templates

### **Composite Actions**

Create custom actions combining multiple steps.

- **Docs**:
  [Creating a composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)
- **Use case**: Package common setup steps (Node.js + dependencies + caching)

### **Dynamic Matrix Generation**

Build matrices from API calls or file changes.

- **Example**: Generate test matrix from changed files
- **Docs**: [Using a matrix for your jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs)

### **Self-Hosted Runners**

Run workflows on your own infrastructure.

- **Docs**:
  [About self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
- **Use cases**: Private networks, special hardware, cost optimization

### **Environment Protection Rules**

Manual approvals and deployment gates.

- **Docs**:
  [Using environments for deployment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)

### **JavaScript Actions**

Build actions with Node.js.

- **Tutorial**:
  [Creating a JavaScript action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action)
- **Toolkit**: [@actions/toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit)

### **Docker Actions**

Containerized custom actions.

- **Tutorial**:
  [Creating a Docker container action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action)
