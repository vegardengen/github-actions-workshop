# Welcome to The GitHub Actions Workshop!

This repository is a hands-on workshop to help you learn GitHub Actions, the powerful CI/CD platform built into GitHub.
You'll find a series of tasks that guide you through creating workflows, automating tasks, and integrating with other
services.

Our goal is to help you become comfortable with GitHub Actions so you'll feel confident when someone asks you to review
or create workflows in your own projects.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a platform that allows you to automate tasks. It lets you set up build scripts, run tests
automatically, deploy applications, and much more, all directly from your GitHub repository.

## What you'll learn in this workshop

- Creating and configuring GitHub Actions workflows
- Understanding triggers, jobs, and steps
- Using pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace
- How to speed up your workflows
- Deploying to GitHub Pages
- And much more!

## Prerequisites

The only thing you need to complete this workshop is a GitHub account. It does also help to have a basic understanding
of Git, GitHub, and YAML syntax, but don't worry if you're new to these concepts - the workshop is designed to be
beginner-friendly!

If you don't have an editor (like VSCode) installed on your computer, you can also complete the workshop using
[GitHub.dev](https://github.dev), which allows you to edit files directly in your browser.

## Getting started

Now we've gotten all the boring stuff out of the way, it's time to get started with the workshop! To get started, follow
